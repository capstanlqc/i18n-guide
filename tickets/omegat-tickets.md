| 2022-Jul-15 | [#43](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/43/tag-tooltips-do-not-show-the-locked-text) | Okapi plugin | Tag tooltips do not show the locked text | Bug | Open! | Denis has opened a pull request #16 for it and sent a manual build of plugin with Okapi dependency at c5fa867 commit. To be tested. |
| 2022-Jun-28 | [#38](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/38/openxml-filter-for-omegat-gives-error-when) | Okapi plugin | OpenXML filter for OmegaT gives error when opening Excel file with embedded HTML | Bug | Open! | Quote TBC. Re-test with latest version of Okapi plugin. Transferred from Okapi issue #1020. |
| 2022-Jun-27 | [#1621](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1621/) | OmegaT | Add notes as <note> in target XLIFF file | RFF | Open! | Green light pending |
| 2022-May-14 | [#37](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/37/html-sub-filter-in-json-filter-not-working) | Okapi plugin | HTML sub-filter in JSON filter not working in OmegaT | Bug | Resolved | Blocking issue for translation JSON files with embedded HTML content in OmegaT. Same as OmegaT #1097. Fixed by Denis Konovalenko in June 2022 (cost: 540, payable by ACER). However, deployment issues remain because Okapi has dropped support for Java 8 while OmegaT is not shipped yet with JRE for Java 11. The patched plugin does not work with OmegaT unless OmegaT is run with Java 11, which therefore needs to be installed manually and OmegaT configured to run with that version. |
| 2022-Apr-08 | [#36](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/36/alternative-translations-do-not-work-for) | Okapi plugin | Alternative translations do not work for repetitions within paragraphs | Bug | Open! | Same as OmegaT #1616, not clear whether this needs to be fixed in OmegaT or in the Okapi filter or in both. |
| 2022-May-31 | [#1101](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1101/) | OmegaT | No ID-bound matching in /tm/tmx2source | RFE | Resolved? | The issue prevents ID-specific translation notes. |
| 2022-May-24 | [#1099](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1099/) | OmegaT | Absolute paths used in search results from TMs | Bug | Resolved | Minor improvement to save space and see more clearly where matches come from. Hiroshi fixed it. |
| 2022-May-24 | [#1098](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1098/) | OmegaT | The "file names" option does not work in search results from TMs | Bug | Resolved | Hiroshi fixed it. |
| 2022-May-12 | [#1617](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1617/) | OmegaT | RFE: handling ID-bound alternative translations more efficiently | RFE | Open | Originally reported as Okapi 1106. |
| 2022-Mar-02 | [#1092](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1092/) | OmegaT | Enforced ID-bound alternative translations not recognized | Bug | Resolved | With Aaron's tips I could find the issue and propose a fix. Fixed in 5.8.1. |
| 2022-Feb-22 | [#1128](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/1128/table-filter-merge-step-does-not-keep) | Okapi | Table filter: Merge step does not keep edited translation | Bug | Open! | Online exchange at https://groups.google.com/g/okapi-users/c/lBo0LRASJyA/m/viK3SfsiBAAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer |

| 2022-Feb-16 | [#1608](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1608/) | OmegaT | Add notes to the translator in /tm/notes/foo.tmx | RFF | Open! | This would be necessary (or very handy) in projects where we need to use second source for a reference version, and it would be confusing to use the same space for translation notes. |
| 2022-Jan-19 | [#35](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/35/improve-tags-conversion-to-match-omegat) | Okapi plugin | Improve tags conversion to match OmegaT tags better | RFE | Open? | Online discussion: https://groups.google.com/g/okapi-users/c/de5LTH7hP4g/m/PysP0msQBwAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer |
| 2021-Sep-24 | [#1070](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1070/) | OmegaT | Unexpected enforced translation (first match) in OmegaT 4.3 | Bug | Open | None |
| 2021-Sep-21 | [#1592](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1592/) | OmegaT | Option to choose how matches are sorted (asc or desc) | RFE | Open~ | None |
| 2021-Sep-21 | [#1591](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1591/) | OmegaT | Option to export project's master TMs when pressing Ctrl+D | RFF | Open | None |

| 2021-May-09 | [#42](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/42/error-parsing-xml-content-with-openxml) | Okapi plugin | Error parsing XML content (with OpenXML filter in OmegaT) | Bug | Open! | Transferred from Okapi issue #1054 |
| 2021-May-09 | [#1566](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1566/) | OmegaT | Replace glossary hits when inserting fuzzy match | RFF | Open | None |
| 2021-May-05 | [#1565](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1565/) | OmegaT | Give each segment a unique ID | RFE | Open!! | Very important, lack of unique segment ID is a common source of support requests and we spend a great deal of time tweaking source files to allow the creation of alternative translations. The problem is mitigated whenever we can use an Okapi filter (OpenXML, HTML, etc.) but Okapi filters sometimes have other issues |
| 2021-Apr-30 | [#1046](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1046/) | OmegaT | Glossary has wrong encoding for non-ASCII characters | Bug | Rejected | None |

| 2020-Dec-10 | [#1027](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1027/) | OmegaT | Resolve Conflicts dialog is useless when enforced matches are updated | Bug | Open | This feature request aims at preventing the problem that users might inadvertedly create bilingual target files (mixing text in the source and the target languages) if they leave some segments untranslated. OmegaT should not opinionatedly use the source text as the translation if the segment is not translated. |
| 2020-Dec-10 | [#1529](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1529/) | OmegaT | Folder scripts/application_close to run scripts when OmegaT closes | RFF | Open | None |

| 2020-Sep-21 | [#1520](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1520/) | OmegaT | Two many locations for user-added plugins | RFE | Rejected | Closed by the dev team lead (Aaron) with the argument that the two locations are necessary. |
| 2020-Sep-21 | [#1519](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1519/) | OmegaT | OmegaT uses wrong/old version of plugin in case of conflict | RFE | Open | Follow up with this. |
| 2020-Aug-14 | [#969](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/969/resname-from-xliff-appears-in-the-comment) | Okapi | Resname (from XLIFF) appears in the comment field in OmegaT | RFE | Open~ | Several details could be optimized in the Comments pane vs Segment Properties pane: resname, ID, comment, etc. Test with JSON to XLIFF roundtrip. |
| 2020-Jul-16 | [#1003](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1003/) | OmegaT | Matches containing non-alphabetical text are ignored in TM leverage | Bug | Open | Could be fixed with diff-patch-match plugin. WIP with mock-up script. |

As soon as it's confirmed, this ticket would have highest priority. |
