## 2022


### [Okapi plugin #37](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/37/html-sub-filter-in-json-filter-not-working) HTML sub-filter in JSON filter not working in OmegaT

Blocking issue for translation JSON files with embedded HTML content in OmegaT. Same as [OmegaT #1097](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1097/). Fixed by Denis Konovalenko in June 2022. However, deployment issues remain because Okapi has dropped support for Java 8 while OmegaT is not shipped yet with JRE for Java 11. The patched plugin does not work with OmegaT unless OmegaT is run with Java 11, which therefore needs to be installed manually and OmegaT configured to run with that version. 

### [Okapi plugin #36](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/36/alternative-translations-do-not-work-for#comment-63775946) Alternative translations do not work for repetitions within paragraphs

Same as [OmegaT #1616](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1616/), not clear whether this needs to be fixed in OmegaT or in the Okapi filter or in both.

### [OmegaT #1101](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1101/) No ID-bound matching in /tm/tmx2source

The issue prevents ID-specific translation notes.

### [OmegaT #1099](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1099/) Absolute paths used in search results from TMs

Minor improvement to save space and see more clearly where matches come from. Hiroshi fixed it.

### [OmegaT #1098](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1098/) The "file names" option does not work in search results from TMs 

Hiroshi fixed it.

### [OmegaT #1617](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1617/) RFE: handling ID-bound alternative translations more efficiently

### [OmegaT #1092](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1092/) Enforced ID-bound alternative translations not recognized 

With Aaron's tips I could find the issue and propose a fix. Fixed in 5.8.1.

### [OmegaT #1090](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1090/) Fails to load TM using <ph> tags

### [OmegaT #1608](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1608/) Add notes to the translator in /tm/notes/foo.tmx

This would be necessary (or very handy) in projects where we need to use second source for a reference version, and it would be confusing to use the same space for translation notes.



## 2021

### [OmegaT #1070](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1070/) Unexpected enforced translation (first match) in OmegaT 4.3

### [OmegaT #1592](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1592/) Option to choose how matches are sorted (asc or desc) 

### [OmegaT #1591](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1591/) Option to export project's master TMs when pressing Ctrl+D 2021-09-21

### [OmegaT #1578](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1578/) Do not propose source text as match from other languages 2021-06-25 

### [OmegaT #1566](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1566/) Replace glossary hits when inserting fuzzy match 2021-05-09

### [OmegaT #1565](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1565/) Give each segment a unique ID

Very important, lack of unique segment ID is a common source of support requests and we spend a great deal of time tweaking source files to allow the creation of alternative translations. The problem is mitigated whenever we can use an Okapi filter (OpenXML, HTML, etc.) but Okapi filters sometimes have other issues 

### [OmegaT #1046](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1046/) Glossary has wrong encoding for non-ASCII characters

### [OmegaT #1038](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1038/) Option "Remove leading and trailing tags" removes tags that are not a tag pair

### [OmegaT #1037](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1037/) Next Unique Segment shortcut conflicts with Log Out on Mac

### [OmegaT #1032](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1032/) OmegaT ignores system variable %appdata% on Windows

### [OmegaT #1546](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1546/) Include OMT plugin in the vanilla installation

### [OmegaT #1027](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1027/) Resolve Conflicts dialog is useless when enforced matches are updated

### [OmegaT #1529](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1529/) Folder `scripts/application_close` to run scripts when OmegaT closes



## 2020

Embed Excel ??? 



### [RFF #1527](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1527/) Do not export untranslated segments 

This feature request aims at preventing the problem that users might inadvertedly create bilingual target files (mixing text in the source and the target languages) if they leave some segments untranslated. OmegaT should not opinionatedly use the source text as the translation if the segment is not translated.

### [OmegaT #1497](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1497/) Automatically create system-wide TM repository (2020-06-28)

> Global TM - RD##?

ticket, + discussion + new discussion -> new ticket??? 
first wait and see, nothing happened -> then propose sponsorship
writing: script to save
reading: looking for developer

### [Bug #1020](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1020/) Project file filters are not preserved

### [Bug #558](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/558/) Incorrect display of RTL segments in the Fuzzy Matches pane 

balbla

### ~~[RFF #1520](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1520/) Two many locations for user-added plugins~~

Closed by the dev team lead (Aaron) with the argument that the two locations are necessary.

### [RFE #1519](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1519/) OmegaT uses wrong/old version of plugin in case of conflict

Follow up with this.

### [Bug #1015](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1015/) Matches ignored if the two locales have the same language subtag

Update (2022_06-24): re-test in version 5.8.0.

### [Bug #1003](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1003/) Matches containing non-alphabetical text are ignored in TM leverage

Could be fixed with diff-patch-match plugin. WIP with mock-up script.

### [Bug #1002](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/1002/) Choice of GUI language during re-installation is ignored 
### [Bug #987](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/987/ )  "Use as default translation" does not work 
### [Bug #988](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/988/) RLE and LRE control characters not visible in editor 
### [Bug #982](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/982/) Layout issues in target Word files in Arabic 
### [Bug #979](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/979/) Arabic fuzzy matches not wrapped in FM pane 
### [Bug #977](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/977/) Character and tag are glued together in Arabic 
### [Bug #975](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/975/) ID-binding context damaged with Olifant-edited TMX files 
### [RFE #1471](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/1471/) RFF: "Full segment" option in search dialog  


### ~~[Bug #1005](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/1005/xliff-filter-for-omegat-hides-files-with): XLIFF filter (for OmegaT) hides files with DOCTYPE including URL~~ 

Not reproduceable.

### [Bug #993](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/993/okapi-xliff-filter-for-omegat-registers) Okapi XLIFF filter for OmegaT registers/expects segment IDs that break ID-bound matches

### [Bug #933](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/933/openxml-filter-formatting-issues-in-arabic): OpenXML filter: formatting issues in Arabic translation (RTL)

On hold, TBC whether Word is the formatting for coding guides in PISA25. As soon as it's confirmed, this ticket would have highest priority. 

### [RFE #969](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/969/resname-from-xliff-appears-in-the-comment): Resname (from XLIFF) appears in the comment field in OmegaT

Several details could be optimized in the Comments pane vs Segment Properties pane: resname, ID, comment, etc. Test with JSON to XLIFF roundtrip.

### [RFE #947](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/947/openxml-filter-improve-the-segmentation): OpenXML Filter: improve the segmentation quality and merge with complex script formatting
	
### [Bug #932](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/okapi/issues/932/hook-for-omegat-translation-kit-not): Hook for OmegaT translation kit not working anymore

### [BUG #23](https://bitbucket.org/okapiframework/omegat-plugin/issues/23/translation-registered-as-same-as-source): Translation registered as same as source not taken into account
